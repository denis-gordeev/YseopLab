A review of the preliminary 2019 tax rolls shows that of the 11 properties an independent appraiser reviewed for the commission in 2018, five have the same assessments as they did in 2017, while the assessments on four have actually gone down and two have gone up. Tax Commission Chairman Lawrence Chehardy says it's too soon to say whether the assessments are potentially problematic because the 2019 tax rolls are still preliminary and will not be finalized until the end of the year.
