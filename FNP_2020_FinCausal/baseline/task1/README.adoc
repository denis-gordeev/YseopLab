Task 1 Baseline
---------------

For task 1, we provide a baseline model based on BERT.

The data available in the *task1/data* repository is the exact partition of the `fnp2020-fincausal-task1.csv` file we used to train and evaluate the baseline.
The preprocessing and splitting process can be reproduced running the *`task1_baseline.py`* script.


Usage
~~~~~

* Run *`task1_preprocess.py`*


Results
~~~~~~~

Results are based on evaluation on the Trial data. Note that results may vary depending on the hardware used.
