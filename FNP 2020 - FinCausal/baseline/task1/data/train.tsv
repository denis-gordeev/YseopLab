1123	0	a	The aim of this exercise is to understand what part of the observed dynamics in PMIs and GDP can be ascribed to the news that was already (and correctly) reflected in financial prices. We do so by resorting to a simple vector autoregression (VAR) model featuring, in order, equity returns, the dollar index, PMI and GDP. 14 This ordering choice can be rationalised with the help of the timeline in Graph 3: within a given month, as financial variables are predetermined with respect to PMIs, they are not allowed to react contemporaneously to PMI-specific shocks. Based on this ordering, the first shock (associated with equity returns) can be interpreted as the continuous flow of news related to macroeconomic (as well as financing) conditions that financial market agents process and incorporate into equity prices at high frequency - before actual numbers for PMIs and GDP are released.
